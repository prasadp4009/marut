# Maruts
##### Small and lightweight RISC-V RV32I SoftCPU Core

*Maruts* is a small and lightweight RISC-V SoftCPU core. It will support RV32I initially.

Maruts is targeted to fit in *Lattice iCE40 Ultra Plus (iCE40UP5K)*. Maruts is an initiative starting with motivation from RISC-V contest and my interest to build smallest RV32I complaint RISC-V SoftCPU core.

Following are the planned features: (Features may change to achieve best performance to area balance)

1. 3-stage pipelined CPU
2. RV32I complaint
3. Novel Adder/Subtractor architecture
4. Branch Prediction Block (if needed)
5. Exception Handeling (if needed)
6. Complete Verilog based design

Timeline of project: (Deadline is November 26, 2018)
